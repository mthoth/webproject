                    <h5>THE AHMAD TEA STORY</h5>
                    <h2>A FAMILY COMPANY BUILT ON VALUES</h2>
                    <p id="parag1">We are a family company founded and run on family values. That means consistently working together year after year, never compromising on our beliefs and always being guided by our shared goals. We only work with the finest tea gardens around the world and we view our tea growers as a natural extension of the Ahmad Tea family. Every blend is sampled seven times during the journey from being plucked to your cup – a process overseen by our Chairman, Mr Rahim Afshar, and his team of world-leading Tea Masters. Nothing leaves our tasting room until we are sure it is an extraordinary cup of tea, destined to inspire tea lovers everywhere.</p>
